This was my first 3D project ever, and I made it using Panda3D, mostly because I'm a Python junkie.  This game is a rarity in that I did all of the art assets myself.  I wanted to create an art style like a child doodling and juxtapose that style to horrors of modern war (particularly suicide bombing).  I originally wanted to do an entirely different type of game, but after I realized just how much time it would take to build all of the art I had to pair it down to something much simpler.  This was my first attempt at using Blender3d and building animated 3D models after all.
